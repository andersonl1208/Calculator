# Graphing Calculator program

This is a web-based graphing calculator.

### To run:
The files needed to run the program locally are contained in the *Calculator* folder. Place these files in the same directory and open the *Calculator.html* file in a modern web browser. It has only been tested in Firefox Version 73.0, and may not work in other browsers. If you wish to modify the program, the other files in the repository contain settings and standards that the code currently follows. Type the function you wish to graph into the text entry box, and click *Graph*.

### Functionality:
- Graphs polynomials
- Handles implicit multiplication
- Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, parentheses, cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, and atan.
- Handles constants e and pi

### Limitations and workarounds:
- Only graphs from -10 to 10 on the x and y axises
- Decimals starting with a . are not handled. Workaround: Type 0.32 instead of .32.
- No hyperbolic functions
- x is the only variable
- No way to evaluate a function at a point / Calculate an answer (It only graphs the function)
